üìñ About the Project

Loans are an integral part of modern financial systems, enabling individuals to manage educational expenses, purchase assets, or cover unforeseen costs. However, assessing a loan applicant‚Äôs eligibility involves analyzing numerous factors, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors.

This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a loan application should be approved or not, based on key features like:

    Applicant Income
    Marital Status
    Credit History
    Property Area, etc.

üìä Dataset Description

The dataset used contains 13 features:
Feature Name	Description
Loan_ID	Unique loan identifier (dropped for modeling)
Gender	Applicant's gender (Male/Female)
Married	Marital status (Yes/No)
Dependents	Number of dependents
Education	Education level (Graduate/Not Graduate)
Self_Employed	Employment type (Yes/No)
ApplicantIncome	Applicant's income
CoapplicantIncome	Co-applicant's income
LoanAmount	Loan amount (in thousands)
Loan_Amount_Term	Loan term (in months)
Credit_History	History of debt repayment
Property_Area	Property location (Rural/Urban/Semi-Urban)
Loan_Status	Loan approval status (Y/N)
‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

    Programming Language: Python
    Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

üîß Implementation Steps

    Data Preprocessing:
        Dropped irrelevant columns (Loan_ID).
        Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding.
        Handled missing values by filling them with column means.

    Data Visualization:
        Visualized categorical variables using bar plots.
        Examined correlations between features using a heatmap.
        Explored relationships using catplots.

    Data Splitting:
        Split the data into training and testing sets (60% training, 40% testing).

    Model Training and Evaluation:
        Used multiple classification algorithms:
            Random Forest Classifier
            K-Nearest Neighbors
            Support Vector Machine
            Logistic Regression
        Evaluated models using accuracy scores.

    Model Selection:
        Selected the best-performing model based on accuracy scores on the test set.

üìà Results

    Accuracy Scores on Test Set:
    Model	Accuracy (%)
    Random Forest Classifier	82.50
    Logistic Regression	80.83
    K-Nearest Neighbors	63.75
    Support Vector Machine	69.17

    Best Model: Random Forest Classifier with 82.5% accuracy.

üöÄ How to Run

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/loan-approval-prediction.git
cd loan-approval-prediction

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the script:

    python main.py

    Modify the dataset file (LoanApprovalPrediction.csv) to test custom inputs.

üìå Conclusion

The Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest accuracy (82.5%) on the test set, making it the most effective model for this loan approval prediction task. Future enhancements could include:

    Implementing ensemble methods like Bagging and Boosting.
    Experimenting with hyperparameter tuning for further optimization.
